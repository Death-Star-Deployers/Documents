## Purpose:
[The purpose or rational for the procedure. If there are policies or standards which this procedure exists to meet, reference them here.]

## Scope:
All employees concerning the new company policy on personal computer usage and security measures.

## Responsibilities:
[Who is responsible for implementing, following, reviewing, maintaining, and updating this policy.]
All employees are responsible for following and maintaining the SOP.

## Prerequisites:
[The information, resources, permissions, etc. required to execute this procedure.]

## Procedure:
[The outline of the activities or sequence of steps for performing the procedure. This should not be overly detailed -- let it capture the shape of the activity to be performed, regardless of how the details of its implementation might change.]
Begin with a flow chart map of the parts of the procedure being defined. This will become your outline
Bundle closely related tasks together for concision, especially if they always occur together/in sequence without much deviation
Work to have 5-7 tasks -- too few and it's not worth reading; too many and it's too hard to read. This is about parsing.
Now revise the flowchart to match the way you have bundled steps and number each steps
Write a concise, focused description for each step
Add a brief opening overview paragraph to describe the topic , inputs, outputs, expected results, and involved roles
