## The Project 
A local chain of grocery stores has survived for years on an ancient system of file-cabinets and paper receipts.
Over the years only a minimal number of computers were added for point-of-sail systems and to comply with the digital ordering systems of their regional and national providers. ("If it's not broke, don't fix it! I've run my company like this just fine for 40 years!" was something she was fond of saying.) A few years ago the founder partially retired, and her two children took over day-to-day operations, and introduced a few more computers to the office, even Wi-Fi! Now the founder is fully retiring and handing the business over the now co-owners, who have big plans to bring their business into the 21st century.
The point-of-sale system is old, but still works fine. They may look into upgrading it in a few years, but for now it is not a priority.
Most of the company's employees work in roles which do not require computers or training.
Employees who do will need computers mostly work in a small central office, though branch managers and assistant managers will also need computers.
Many employees have been unofficially bringing and using their own computers at work for years, using them to email spreadsheets to one another, but there is no SOP and no training for how these computers are used, or any type of security training or requirements.
By and large, employees have very low computer skills.
Over the years the original paper inventory management system has been variously and incompletely supplemented or replicated in excel spreadsheets, emailed back and forth and passed down from employee to employee.
That situation is a mess, and the new owners intend to implement a modern, database-backed inventory management system using some kind of off-the shelf commercial software. That is more than they can tackle this year though, but for now they would still like you to set up a server which could be used to host this software in the future. 
This is our company pitch of how we would we would take care if we were successfull all of our sop's, statement of work, script, presentation and contact informantion can be found in this readme.
